                <h2>What are Frameworks?</h2><br>

                <p>You can imagine Frameworks like a frame of a Picture which keeps everything in place and determines a
                    form. The picture in the
                    frame has to match the conditions the frame pretends. Furthermore the frame provides everything the
                    picture, or imagine a project, should have
                    and if you happen do to do the same project (like Websites, Games, etc.) over and over, you probably
                    understand how usefull it is, if the base of
                    the project is already set wtih a framework. The Big-Win of frameworks is that the features which
                    they provide are standardized, easy to implement, proofed by many people and
                    on point.

                <h2>What is Bootstrap?</h2><br>

                <p>Bootstrap is a Framework which is based on the styling language CSS and the scripting language HTML.
                    It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grid
                    systems, navigation
                    and other surface design elements as well as additional, optional JavaScript extensions.</p>

                <h2>Can I customize my product after delivery?</h2><br>

                <p>Of course you can. Many people ask me this question, and it always depends of how much experience you
                    have with the understanding of "how the World Wide Web is built". In any project you like, I can
                    implement an
                    Admin-Tool which provides all the features to customize certain parts of your Website/Webapplication
                    really easy. This is similar to Webbuilders, but because it focuses on certain parts, it is often
                    even easier and more clear to use.
                    If you want full control, I can always give a quick look into the code of your product to make some
                    changes by yourself. I am also always available for support after delivery. </p> <br><br>

                <h2>When should I use a Website-Builder like Wordpress, Shopify, etc.?</h2><br>

                <p>If you're on of the persons who like to design and build by yourself. If you need for example a
                    Webshop or something like an Webapplication with a little greater effort and your maybe in the
                    starting phase of
                    your buisness, a Webbuilder can be a really good tool for you to get started. On the other side if
                    you just need a nice litte Website for your web-presence or a really complex and awesome
                    Webapplikation, maybe because
                    you own a little bigger company or just for personal purpose, I would definetly not recommend to use
                    tools like this. This comes with the reason that many of these tools only provide a limited amount
                    of features for free
                    and you need to pay for additional ones. Also pricing comes with subscriptions and you have to pay
                    an amount every month, whetever if its just a little Add-On or a Styling-Template you like to use.
                    Hosting and other things
                    will be included in this subscription but if you like to have a personal website adress you'll still
                    need to purchase a Domain anyway. And also one of the most important reasons, especially for bigger
                    companys, you do not own
                    your Website unless you got the code for it in your hands and yours alone. Data security also runs
                    always over this third party. And last but not least, much people offer you to build Websites with
                    these tools for nearly the same
                    pricing of an custom made Website other programmers offer you. This is somehow ridiculous, if you
                    keep in my mind that this tools are build to create Websites by yourself. But it also shows that
                    many of these tools like Wordpress
                    are not that easy to use for some people as you would think in the first place.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Notice: there are many ways to host your Website or Webapplication for free.</p><br><br>

                <h2>How does working with me look like?</h2><br>

                <p>First of all I would like to take a little chat with you to get to know each other better. This can
                    happen via Skype, Zoom, Discord, Fiverr, or just
                    simple chat or phone. In this conversation we can have an exchange about what your personal ideas
                    and preferences for your project are. After this I will
                    take some time and give you feedback about how I will implement your Website or Webapplication. At
                    this point you can of course tell me if your satisfied
                    with my approach or not really convinced by it. If the second one is the case, you can always decide
                    to cancel your work with me or I will try to find another approach
                    if you like. But if all is ready to go, I will start working on your project and stay in contact
                    with you to give you regulary feedback about your project and
                    talk about further changes or new ideas. The project will be ready in the discussed period and in
                    some cases maybe even earlier.
                    At the end I will present your project and hand it over to you. There is always a money back
                    guarantee if your are not satisfied at this point. After this we cam
                    talk about things like hosting and support for your project or just go with it and handle the rest
                    by yourself.
