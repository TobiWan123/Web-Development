            <h2>Projects Basic Headings</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This is the Basic section of my projects. These are projects which are really lightweight and took not
                much time for me to build or
                consist of standard technologies like only HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. Of course these Projects do not
                neccesarly lack anything behind the Projects
                of the Advanced Section. There you will find Projects consisting of Framworks like Angular and more
                complex approaches with Backend's.
                Prices on these Projects are often lower, because of the faster Production time and much more simpler
                approach - perfect for Basic Websites.

                    <p>This website right here is my first professional project. It fullfills all features and
                        requirements which are standard for webpages these days.
                        All webpages are fully responsive and HTML and CSS is validated by W3C. Also it reaches a high
                        browser compability over all browsers.

                        <br><br>
                        <p>This website was built in order to represent me and my work in Web-Developement. You can find
                            a lot of the
                            projects I
                            have done so far aswell as some skills.
                            The Website is completly responsive and the code is also super clean and validated by W3C.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>What is W3C?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the
                            World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led
                            by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain
                            full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>This project is also completly static, which means it is really easy to host and has
                            lightweight code without PHP for example. Static
                            in this context means that this project does not posses a backend.
                            Because of this I also needed to implement a special functionality to receive messages to my
                            google account through the contact formular of this site.
                            Normally you would use a function mail() in PHP (dynamic, backend) or other non static
                            approaches, but this is not that
                            easy to host and with a SMTP-Server for mailing mostly not free.
                            Some hosting-services include the possibility to receive mails through the service but this
                            also comes with costs in some cases. So the best opportunity for me
                            was to do it by myself. With Google-Sheets I could fix this problem. This Website is for an
                            international audience so it is not multilingual, but maybe I'll add some
                            additional languages like German and Chinese in the future.
